In this document, I try to explain the concept the Dependency Injection in Android with regards to using Dagger in Android applications, the core usages and workflow of different components in the Dagger Framework. I write this as I learn, so it's very possible that updates would keep coming in as I gather more information.

If you want to contribute to any of the enlisted explanations and illustrations, feel free to submit a PR.
